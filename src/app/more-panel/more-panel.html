      A sleek and responsive web platform built to help users know about me. Developed using Angular
      and TypeScript the app features, real-time data updates, and a modern UI inspired by natural
      minimalism. I handled both front-end logic and API integration, ensuring smooth navigation and
      fast loading times across devices. The project demonstrates my focus on performance,
      accessibility, and clean component architecture.
